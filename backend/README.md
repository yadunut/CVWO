# CVWO Assignment Sample Golang App

This sample Golang app is provided to help you experiment and practice web development fundamentals.
It shows how certain functionality can be implemented.
However, do note that this is **far from a model example**.
After all, we want to see how you maximise your learning in web development
and good software development practices.

## Getting Started

### Installing Go

Download and install Go by following the instructions [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).

### Running the app
1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) this repo.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) **your** forked repo.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing your cloned project.
4. Run `go run cmd/server/main.go` and head over to http://localhost:8000/users to view the response.


### Navigating the code
This is the main file structure. Note that this is simply *one of* various paradigms to organise your code, and is just a bare starting point.
```
.
├── cmd
│   ├── server
├── internal
│   ├── api         # Encapsulates types and utilities related to the API
│   ├── dataacess   # Data Access layer accesses data from the database
│   ├── database    # Encapsulates the types and utilities related to the database
│   ├── handlers    # Handler functions to respond to requests
│   ├── models      # Definitions of objects used in the application
│   ├── router      # Encapsulates types and utilities related to the router
│   ├── routes      # Defines routes that are used in the application
├── README.md
├── go.mod
└── go.sum
```

Main directories/files to note:
* `cmd` contains the main entry point for the application
* `internal` holds most of the functional code for your project that is specific to the core logic of your application
* `README.md` is a form of documentation about the project. It is what you are reading right now.
* `go.mod` contains important metadata, for example, the dependencies in the project. See [here](https://go.dev/ref/mod) for more information
* `go.sum` See [here](https://go.dev/ref/mod) for more information

Try changing some source code and see how the app changes.

## Next Steps

* This project uses [go-chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) as a web framework. Feel free to explore other web frameworks such as [gin-gonic](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin). Compare their pros and cons and use whatever that best justifies the trade-offs.
* Read up more on the [MVC framework](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC) which this code is designed upon.
* Sometimes, code formatting can get messy and opiniated. Do see how you can incoporate [linters](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) to format your code.
